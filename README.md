> **Adaptive publishing infrastructure for the sovereign web.**
> SQLite-first, zero-trust, zero telemetry. Policy-governed runtime with adaptive system modes, sandboxed plugins, transactional event outbox, durable audit trail, and fault-tolerant federated publishing.

## What's New in v1.1.0

> Full notes in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) · upgrade steps in [`docs/UPGRADING.md`](docs/UPGRADING.md)

- **Built-in `vayupress migrate` command** — import Markdown folders straight
  into the database (`migrate markdown`, `migrate list`, `migrate info`); no
  separate tool to build. Idempotent (`INSERT OR IGNORE`), YAML-frontmatter
  aware, with `--dry-run`.
- **Multi-format post editor** — author each post in **Markdown _or_ raw HTML**
  via a segmented toggle. The chosen format and editable source round-trip
  losslessly through the new `article_sources` side-car table (migration 018);
  the public renderer always receives server-sanitised HTML.
- **Dual-write autosave** — every save persists the editable source *and* the
  rendered HTML in parallel; new posts create-and-redirect to a permanent URL.
- **Security hardening** — HTML-escaped article title/slug in the admin
  dashboard, XML-escaped sitemap `<loc>` slugs, and CDATA-injection defence in
  the RSS feed (security review 2026-06-19).

### Upgrading from v1.0.0
No breaking changes. Start the server once and migration 018 applies
automatically. The legacy `/admin` console is untouched. Existing posts open in
the editor in HTML mode until first saved in Markdown mode.

## Platform Screenshots

> Screenshots are regenerated automatically from a live instance by the
> [screenshots CI workflow](.github/workflows/screenshots.yml) and committed
> back to `docs/screenshots/`. Run it via **GitHub → Actions → screenshots → Run workflow**.

### Public Homepage
![VayuPress Homepage](docs/screenshots/homepage.png)

*Public homepage — article grid with tag filtering, dark/light mode toggle, zero-telemetry footer, system mode indicator. Styled on vendored Pico CSS served locally to keep the strict `style-src 'self'` CSP intact.*

### Article Page
![VayuPress Article](docs/screenshots/article-page.png)

*Rendered article — JSON-LD schema, author/date meta, tag strip, reading time, zero third-party requests.*

---

### Admin v2 — Editor-First Redesign

![VayuPress Admin v2 Dashboard](docs/screenshots/admin-v2-dashboard.png)

*Modern, editor-first admin (`/admin/v2`) on a fully-vendored, CSP-strict stack — dark-first, teal/saffron palette, no external CDNs, no `unsafe-eval`/`unsafe-inline` (ADR-0065).*

![VayuPress Admin v2 Editor](docs/screenshots/admin-v2-editor.png)

*The editor — **multi-format authoring** (Markdown ⇄ raw HTML toggle), split-view live preview, slash-command palette, formatting toolbar, drag-&-drop / paste image upload, word-count / reading-time, SEO readiness meter, and debounced autosave over the existing CSRF-protected API. The editable source + format round-trip through a side-car table while the public renderer always receives server-sanitised HTML. All interactivity is eval-free.*

### Admin Dashboard (Classic Console)
![VayuPress Admin Dashboard](docs/screenshots/admin-dashboard.png)

*Runtime governance console — system mode (Normal/Degraded/ReadOnly/Recovery/Maintenance/Quarantined), SLO error budgets with contributor attribution, dependency health grid, kernel invariant checklist, operational timeline with epistemic confidence annotations.*

### Theme & Site Settings Control Panel
![VayuPress Theme Control Panel](docs/screenshots/theme-panel.png)

*Theme console — identity fields, palette editor with live hex+swatch sync and WCAG AA contrast advisory, custom CSS (16 KB, served same-origin via `/theme.css`), declarative `<head>` capabilities, and custom favicon/logo upload (PNG/ICO, magic-number validated, stored in the database). Themes round-trip as a portable JSON bundle via **Export / Import**, and a one-click **Reset to Defaults** restores the factory palette. The public site ships a self-hosted **dark/light mode toggle** (no third-party fonts or scripts — `script-src 'self'`). All changes are mode-gated, CSRF-protected governed writes.*

### System Modes & Policy Engine
![VayuPress Policy Modes](docs/screenshots/policy-modes.png)

*Platform control plane — 6 adaptive system modes with validated transition graph, append-only mode history, and all registered policies with live pass/warn/fail status.*

### Policy Provenance Inspector (Ω11)
![VayuPress Policy Inspector](docs/screenshots/policy-inspector.png)

*Live policy evaluation table — per-policy category/severity/result strip, run-history trend, and persistent evaluation log for provenance and trend analysis.*

### Runtime Topology (Ω9)
![VayuPress Runtime Topology](docs/screenshots/runtime-topology.png)

*Interactive operator console — 17-node live runtime graph (write path, delivery/read, governance, observability) with health derived in real time from failed-job counts, current mode, and fault-escalation state.*

### Replay Explorer (Ω10)
![VayuPress Replay Explorer](docs/screenshots/replay-explorer.png)

*Write-job lifecycle inspector — dead-letter & poison-queue surface with single-job and batch requeue, full lifecycle chain (pending → processing → completed → retry ×3 → dead-letter → replay ×3 → quarantined).*

### Fault Manager
![VayuPress Fault Manager](docs/screenshots/fault-manager.png)

*Fault escalation surface — active faults with severity level, trigger source, and escalation path through the mode state machine.*

### ADR Registry
![VayuPress ADR Registry](docs/screenshots/adr-registry.png)

*Architecture Decision Records — every design decision indexed with status, date, and rationale. Governance documentation lives in the running system, not a separate wiki.*

## What Is VayuPress?

VayuPress ("Vayu" — Sanskrit for wind/speed) is governed publishing infrastructure for developers, writers, and AI-assisted content engines who need:

- **Adaptive runtime governance** — policy-driven system modes (Normal/Degraded/ReadOnly/Recovery/Maintenance/Quarantined) with validated transition graph and operational convergence
- **Single-VPS efficiency** — runs on 12 GB RAM / 6 vCPU / 250 GB NVMe
- **Total control** over content, hosting, and data
- **No vendor lock-in** — SQLite, Go, Nginx, open standards only
- **Zero telemetry** — no tracking, no analytics harvesting, no third-party calls
- **Platform-kernel integrity** — immutable signing, migration integrity, identity model, event durability, and audit trail enforced by the policy engine
- **Security-first** — sandboxed subprocess plugins, capability enforcement, SSRF protection, durable replay protection, WORM audit log
- **Full observability** — structured JSON logging, distributed tracing, SLO error budgets, fault injection framework

## Platform Kernel

VayuPress has an **immutable platform kernel** — components that define invariants no plugin, extension, or subsystem can bypass. Changes require an RFC and 2/3 supermajority vote.

| Component | Package | Invariant |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Signing** | `internal/signing` | Every published article has a valid Ed25519 signature |
| **Capability Enforcement** | `internal/sandbox` | Plugin capabilities checked against manifest before every Invoke() |
| **Migration Integrity** | `internal/migrations` | Checksums verified against embedded SQL; drift is a hard error |
| **Identity Model** | `internal/did` | DID:key authentication; no shared-secret fallback |
| **Event Durability** | `internal/outbox` | Events written to outbox in same transaction as state change |
| **Audit Trail** | `internal/migrations` (journal) | Migration journal is append-only; no entry may be deleted |
| **SLO Error Budget** | `internal/slo` | BudgetExhausted() blocks the release gate |
| **Policy Engine** | `internal/policy` | All governance policies registered here; no ad hoc enforcement |

See [docs/architecture/kernel-boundary.md](docs/architecture/kernel-boundary.md) for the full kernel boundary specification.

---

## System Modes

VayuPress operates in one of six adaptive system modes, governed by the policy engine:

| Mode | Trigger | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `normal` | Default | All subsystems fully operational |
| `degraded` | SLO error budget exhausted | Feature work pauses; writes allowed |
| `read-only` | Migration checksum drift | Writes refused; recovery required |
| `recovery` | Active recovery operation | Migration apply allowed; writes blocked |
| `maintenance` | Operator-initiated | Planned downtime; controlled shutdown |
| `quarantined` | Plugin quarantine threshold | Plugin and federation suspended |

Transitions are validated against a deterministic graph. Every transition is logged to an append-only history. Policy evaluation drives automatic transitions; operators can force transitions via CLI.

See [docs/architecture/system-modes.md](docs/architecture/system-modes.md).

## Feature List (P1–P27 + Ω1–Ω11)

### Core Publishing (P1–P8)
- RESTful JSON API for articles (CRUD with slugs, tags, full-text content)
- Async write queue — SQLite-backed, crash-safe, with dead-letter replay
- Sitemap XML, RSS feed, and robots.txt auto-generation
- In-memory render cache with static-file output via Nginx
- SQLite WAL mode with adaptive checkpointing
- Migration checksum drift detection — halts startup on tampering
- Immutable WORM audit log via SQLite `ABORT` triggers
- Plugin hook system with worker pool, panic recovery, and circuit-breaker disable

### Security & Governance (P9–P13)
- Automated CI governance — 15+ CI jobs, `ci-pass` gate
- Supply-chain secret scanning (TruffleHog), license compliance, shell linting
- Structured health contracts: `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/health/dependencies`, `/health/storage`, `/health/search`, `/health/queue`
- `/health/ethics` — machine-readable ethics compliance endpoint
- Ethical AI Charter in `ETHICS.md` (no training on user data, no telemetry)

### Multi-Package Architecture (P14–P19)
- 35+ `internal/` packages with compiler-enforced boundaries
- `App` struct owns all mutable runtime state — no package-level globals
- Repository pattern: `ArticleRepo` interface backed by SQLite
- Integration test harness with `go test -race ./...`

### Event-Driven Reliability (P20–P22)
- Transactional outbox — events written atomically with article mutations
- `lifecycle.Manager` — ordered startup/shutdown with registered components
- Typed event structs with versioned schemas (`article.created.v1`)
- Idempotent dispatch via `delivered_events` deduplication table

### Observability & Tracing (P22–P23)
- Structured JSON logging with `LogFields` — correlation/causation IDs on every line
- Span-based tracing: `Start`, `SetAttribute`, `End`
- SLO error budgets with rolling windows — 5 production SLOs tracked

### Resource Governance & Sandboxing (P24–P26)
- Named semaphore limiters (`articles.write`, `plugin.exec`)
- Subprocess IPC pool for out-of-process plugin execution
- Linux seccomp filtering and namespace isolation for subprocess plugins
- Capability enforcement — subprocess plugins run with dropped privileges

### Platform Stewardship (Ω1–Ω5)
- **Security audit corpus** — 6 security documents (attack surfaces, trust model, incident response, federation threats, sandbox boundaries, signing model)
- **Compatibility contracts** — stability matrix for 30+ packages, golden tests for Stable API contracts
- **Architecture governance** — bounded-context rules, ADR index (23 ADRs), import-layer validator
- **Migration resilience** — dry-run, checksum verification, append-only journal, rollback simulation
- **Federation adversarial hardening** — malformed payload rejection, SQLite-durable replay protection
- **Platform Policy Engine** — 6 canonical policies (architecture, security, reliability, release) unified under `internal/policy`
- **WAL concurrency** — stress tests verifying write serialisation and busy-timeout behaviour
- **Kernel boundary document** — immutable vs replaceable component classification
- **System Modes** — 6-mode adaptive state machine with validated transition graph, policy-driven automatic transitions, and subsystem hook registry
- **Fault injection framework** — named probabilistic fault points with deterministic replay for adversarial testing

### Operational Cognition & Operator Console (Ω6–Ω11)
- **Ω6 — Durable mode journal** — every system-mode transition persisted to SQLite with cause attribution; survives restart
- **Ω7 — Kernel/trace/event/fault panels** — live runtime introspection surfaces on the admin dashboard
- **Ω8 — Unified Operational Timeline** — single causal narrative correlating mode transitions, faults, escalations, and queue events with relative + wall-clock time
- **Ω9 — Interactive operator console** — real control-plane pages that mutate live runtime state:
  - **System Mode Engine** (`/admin/modes`) — drive transitions through the validated graph; invalid moves rejected 409
  - **Fault Engine** (`/admin/faults`) — operator-driven fault simulation feeding the escalation threshold
  - **Runtime Topology** (`/admin/topology`) — 17-node live health graph
- **Ω10 — Live-streaming timeline + Replay Explorer** — animated causal arrows, STREAMING poller, and a dead-letter / poison-queue inspector (`/admin/replay`) with single-job and batch requeue
- **Ω11 — Policy Provenance Inspector** (`/admin/policy`) — SQLite-journaled policy evaluations (`policy_evaluations` table), live pass/warn/fail status, run-history trend sparkline, and a persistent provenance log of every policy run

### Theme & Site Settings Control Panel (`/admin/theme`)

A governed customisation surface — every input is validated, no raw markup is
trusted, and the strict CSP stays intact:

- **Identity** — site name, tagline, meta description, author. Baked into every
  public page; a save triggers a full rendered-cache purge so changes propagate.
- **Palette** — light/dark primary + accent colours (hex-validated). Rendered as
  Pico CSS-variable overrides and served same-origin at **`/theme.css`** (ETag +
  short max-age) — never inlined, so `style-src 'self'` holds. The first-deploy
  defaults match the vendored `custom.css`, so there is no flash-of-unstyled-content.
- **Custom CSS** — operator stylesheet, 16 KB cap, folded into `/theme.css`.
  Cannot reach external origins or execute scripts (CSP-contained).
- **Head & SEO** — *declarative, allowlisted* capabilities (keywords, theme-color,
  robots, Google/Bing verification) rendered to escaped `<meta>` tags. Raw `<head>`
  HTML is intentionally **not** accepted — meta-refresh redirects, external
  beacons, and `<base>` hijacks are structurally impossible, not merely filtered.
- **Storage & safety** — persisted in the `site_settings` table (migration 006,
  content-checksummed like every migration); writes are CSRF-protected, blocked in
  `read-only`/`quarantined` modes, and audit-logged (`component: "theme"`).
- **Public theme toggle** — a sun/moon switch in the site header persists the
  reader's choice in `localStorage`; served as a same-origin script so it needs no
  CSP nonce (which cached HTML cannot carry).
- **CSP telemetry** — violations report to `POST /csp-report`, incrementing
  `vayupress_csp_violations_total` and logging the offending directive, so runtime
  CSP drift is observable rather than silent.

## Companion Tools

> **New in v1.1.0 — built-in `migrate` command.** The main binary now imports
> Markdown folders directly, no separate tool to build:
> ```bash
> vayupress migrate markdown --dir ./posts --dry-run   # preview
> vayupress migrate markdown --dir ./posts             # import
> vayupress migrate info                               # all platform options
> ```
> Imports write both the sanitised article and an `article_sources` side-car so
> the Admin v2 editor reopens each post in Markdown mode. See
> [`docs/MIGRATION.md`](docs/MIGRATION.md) for the full guide.

Standalone migration and import tools live under [`tools/`](tools/). Each is an
independent Go module — builds without pulling in the engine.

### Migration Tools

```

### Built-in Plugin Features

These features are part of VayuPress core (no external service required):

| Feature | Package | API |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **SEO Optimizer** | `internal/seo` | Auto OpenGraph, Twitter Card, JSON-LD per article |
| **Comments** | `internal/comments` | `POST /api/v1/articles/{slug}/comments` + moderation |
| **Article Versions** | `internal/versions` | `GET /api/v1/admin/articles/{slug}/versions` |
| **Series/Collections** | `internal/collections` | `GET/POST /api/v1/collections` |
| **Newsletter** | `internal/newsletter` | `POST /api/v1/newsletter/subscribe` |
| **Webmentions** | `internal/webmention` | `POST /webmention` (W3C receiver) |
| **Draft Preview Links** | `internal/preview` | `POST /api/v1/admin/preview` |
| **Redirect Manager** | `internal/redirects` | `GET/POST /api/v1/admin/redirects` |
| **Table of Contents** | `internal/toc` | `GET /api/v1/articles/{slug}/toc` |
| **ActivityPub / Federation** | `internal/federation` | Outbox relay + HTTP Signatures |

| **Content Signing** | `internal/signing` | HMAC article verification |
| **Sovereign Self-Update** | `internal/update` | Check-only web API + signature-verified CLI apply |

### Modern Admin UI (`/admin/v2`)

An editor-first admin redesign on a fully vendored, CSP-compliant stack (no
CDNs, no `unsafe-eval`) — served alongside the untouched legacy `/admin`. The
editor has split-view live preview, a slash-command palette, distraction-free
mode, word count / reading time, an SEO preview, debounced autosave, and version
history. See [docs/ADMIN-UI.md](docs/ADMIN-UI.md) and
[ADR-0065](docs/adr/ADR-0065-admin-ui-csp-compliant-stack.md).

### Self-Update

VayuPress can check for and apply its own updates **sovereignly and safely**:

```bash
vayupress update check               # read-only version/changelog check
vayupress update apply --dry-run     # verify checksum + Ed25519 signature, change nothing
vayupress update apply               # gated, signed, backed-up binary swap (CLI-only)
```

The web panel can only *check* (`GET /admin/api/updates/check`). Applying an
update is **CLI-only**, requires opt-in (`VAYU_SELFUPDATE_ENABLED=true`) and an
operator-pinned Ed25519 key (`VAYU_RELEASE_PUBKEY`), is refused in
read-only/quarantine/maintenance mode, backs up the database first, and never
auto-restarts. See [docs/UPGRADING.md](docs/UPGRADING.md),
[docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md), and
[ADR-0064](docs/adr/ADR-0064-sovereign-self-update.md).

## Performance

Target: ≤50 ms p95 latency on a 4-vCPU VPS under sustained load.

### Measured — end-to-end load (built-in benchmark harness)

Real numbers from the in-process load benchmark (`POST /admin/benchmark`) on a
**4-vCPU Intel Xeon @ 2.80 GHz, 16 GB** box, SQLite in WAL mode, 20 concurrent
readers against the cached render path:

| Metric | Measured | Target | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Read p50 | **16 ms** | — | — |
| Read p95 | **16 ms** | <50 ms | ✅ PASS |
| Read p99 | **16 ms** | <50 ms | ✅ PASS |
| Read throughput | **~8,700 RPS** | — | — |
| Read mean | **8.2 ms** | — | — |

### Measured — micro-benchmarks (`go test -bench`)

| Operation | Package | ns/op | allocs/op |
|-----------|---------|------:|----------:|
| Ed25519 sign | `internal/signing` | **28,423** (28.4 µs) | 7 |
| Ed25519 verify | `internal/signing` | **64,133** (64.1 µs) | 4 |
| Article input validation | `internal/api` | **234** | 0 |
| Slug validation | `internal/api` | **384** | 0 |
| Migration apply (full) | `internal/migrations` | **142,151** (142 µs) | 102 |
| Event schema validate | `internal/events/schema` | **196** | 0 |
| Merkle proof generation | `internal/merkle` | **1,403** | 20 |
| Histogram record (metrics) | `internal/metrics` | **18.3** | 0 |
| Cache hit-ratio read | `internal/metrics` | **0.46** | 0 |

Hot-path validation and metrics are **zero-allocation**. Reproduce with:

```bash
make bench                                  # committed baselines
go test -bench=. -benchmem -run=^$ ./...    # full micro-benchmark sweep
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: $KEY" .../admin/benchmark   # live end-to-end load
```

| Static metric | Value | Mechanism |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Cold start | <500 ms | Single static binary |
| Production binary | `-ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath` | Stripped, reproducible |
| Article page serving | Nginx static + in-memory render cache | No per-request render |

## Governance

VayuPress is governed by the [VayuPress Governance Constitution v6.0](GOVERNANCE-CONSTITUTION.md).

**Priority order (non-negotiable):**
Security = Data Integrity > Ethical Compliance > Reliability > Simplicity > Performance > DX > Feature Velocity

All governance policies are enforced by the Platform Policy Engine (`internal/policy`) and validated in CI on every push.
